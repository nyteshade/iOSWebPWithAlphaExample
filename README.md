iOSWebPWithAlphaExample
=======================

iOS example using Google's WebP

Using directions created by Carson McDonald, I've created an easy to use UIImage category with a single
function for loading a webp image from your app's bundle. It tries to do load an @2x version if the app
is running in retina mode.

This example includes a compiled version of Google's webp framework for iOS, and the iOS Simulator. It
was built using the directions provided by Carson McDonald here:
